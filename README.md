# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was undertaken to review temperature data in Oahu for the months of June and December.  In order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is a sustainable year-round endeavor, a review of the data for these two months should reveal if Oahu has year-round temperatures that are ideal for surfing and eating ice cream.
