# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was undertaken to review temperature data in Oahu for the months of June and December.  In order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is a sustainable year-round endeavor, a review of the data for these two months should reveal if Oahu has year-round temperatures that are ideal for surfing and eating ice cream.

## Analysis
 - The average temperature is 74.9°F historically in June and 71.0°F in December
 - There doesn't appear to be a lot of volatility in temperatures, as the standard deviations are 3.26° and 3.75° respectively for June and December
 - Only 25% of readings were below 73°F in June, and only 25% of readings were below 69°F in December

 ## Summary
 Given that temperatures rarely drop below 70°F regardless if it is the month of June or December, it appears that there could be year round demand for a surfing and ice cream shop.  There appears to be little volatility to the temperatures in Oahu, which is good in a business that can be impacted by the weather.  As we begin to get closer to the launch of this endeavor, it would be good to run similar temperature analyses for every month of the year.  This could be useful information to have when determining the appropriate times to run promotions.  It would also be useful to gather precipitation information by month.  Even if temperatures are warm, there may not be a high demand for surfing and ice cream if there is a lot of precipitation in a given month.
